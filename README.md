Big Data Analytics Assignment 1 

In this file, I am comparing different sectors' performace, measured through ETFs, to the performance of the S&P

I am getting my historical data using Alpha Vantage. The prices are being reported daily at closing price.

First, I am creating a list to put all of my data into.
Then I am using Alpha Vantage to pull all the data from my 11 sector funds

Then I will consolidate the data into a dataframe.

Using matplotlib I am creating 11 seperate plots to show the price of the sector ETF compared to the S&P to see which ones are folllowing the market.

Then I am running a regressionn correlation to check if there is any correlation between the funds and the index.
